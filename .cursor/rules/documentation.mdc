# Documentation Rule

## Documentation Location

**All project documentation files created by the AI must be saved in the `.cursor/` folder.**

### What counts as documentation:

- Project structure guides
- Setup instructions
- Architecture overviews
- Feature documentation
- API documentation
- Style guides
- Development notes
- Any README files (unless specifically requested in another location)
- Markdown files explaining project concepts

### Examples:

✅ **Correct locations:**

- `.cursor/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `.cursor/SETUP.md`
- `.cursor/FEATURES.md`
- `.cursor/API_GUIDE.md`
- `.cursor/ARCHITECTURE.md`

❌ **Incorrect locations:**

- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (root)
- `docs/setup.md` (unless explicitly requested)
- `README.md` (root - unless explicitly requested)

### Exception:

The only exception is when the user **explicitly requests** documentation in a specific location (e.g., "create a README.md in the root folder").

### Rationale:

- Keeps project root clean
- Organizes all AI-generated documentation in one place
- Easy to find and maintain
- Doesn't interfere with source code structure
