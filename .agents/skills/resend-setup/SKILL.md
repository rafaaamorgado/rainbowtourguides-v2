# Resend Setup

To set up Resend Setup, refer to the fullstackrecipes MCP server resource:

**Resource URI:** `recipe://fullstackrecipes.com/resend-setup`

If the MCP server is not configured, fetch the recipe directly:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/plain" https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/recipes/resend-setup
```
