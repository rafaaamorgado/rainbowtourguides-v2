\# Founder Clarity Brief Simplified  
\*\*Product:\*\* Rainbow Tour Guides v2 (rainbowtourguides.com)    
\*\*Positioning:\*\* Premium • Safety-first • LGBTQ+ local connection    
\*\*Wedge (SEO):\*\* “LGBTQ+ private guide in \[City\]”

\---

\#\# 1\) What are we building?

\#\#\# 1.1 The v2 product (what exists at launch)  
\*\*Rainbow Tour Guides v2\*\* is a \*\*premium LGBTQ+ travel marketplace\*\* where travelers book \*\*private, safe, authentic\*\* experiences with \*\*verified queer or LGBTQ+-friendly local guides\*\*.

\*\*In plain terms:\*\*  
\> A platform where LGBTQ+ travelers (and allies) can browse curated cities, choose vetted local guides, request a booking, coordinate in-app, pay securely, complete the tour, and leave reviews — with a small but real operations layer that enforces safety and quality.

\*\*The v2 “must be true”:\*\*  
\- Cities & guides are \*\*discoverable\*\* (SEO-friendly)  
\- Guides are \*\*verified \+ approved\*\* before listing  
\- Bookings work end-to-end: \*\*request → guide decision → payment → messages → completion → review\*\*  
\- Admins can operate the marketplace: \*\*approve/reject guides, manage bookings, handle disputes/refunds\*\*

\#\#\# 1.2 The north star (what it becomes)  
Over time, RTG evolves into:  
\- \*\*A curated ecosystem\*\* of guides \+ experiences \+ trusted queer-friendly partners  
\- A \*\*premium concierge layer\*\* (trip planning, safety-first recommendations, “a friend in every city”)  
\- A \*\*community layer\*\* (events, meetups, partner venues)

\*\*Important:\*\* v2 is not a “demo.” It’s the first production step on a scalable stack.

\---

\#\# 2\) Who is it for?

\#\#\# 2.1 Primary traveler segment (v2)  
\*\*Independent Queer Explorer (core buyer)\*\*  
\- Gay/queer men, \~30–55, mid–upper income  
\- Often travels solo 2–4x/year for 3–5 days (city trips)  
\- Wants \*\*safety \+ connection \+ authenticity\*\* (not hookups)  
\- Will pay \*\*premium\*\* when trust is clear

\*\*Core emotional job:\*\* “Help me feel safe, seen, and connected — without awkwardness.”

\#\#\# 2.2 Secondary traveler segment (v2)  
\*\*Cultured Gay Couples\*\*  
\- Couples, \~45–65, upper-middle to affluent  
\- Prioritize culture, food, ease, privacy, calm professionalism  
\- Wants a guide who feels like a \*\*trusted local host\*\*, not nightlife chaos

\#\#\# 2.3 Guide segment (v2)  
\*\*Local Queer Culture Curators\*\*  
\- LGBTQ+ or \*\*LGBTQ+-friendly\*\* guides (see policy below)  
\- Usually 25–45, proud of their city, guiding is meaningful income  
\- Needs structure (pricing, calendar, bookings), reliable payouts, and boundaries  
\- Doesn’t want to be commoditized into “rent-a-friend”

\*\*Core job:\*\* “Let me host great travelers safely, flexibly, and professionally.”

\#\#\# 2.4 Admin / ops (v2)  
\- Initially: \*\*Rafa \+ Alan\*\*  
\- Core needs: guide approvals, content control, dispute handling, visibility into bookings and money

\---

\#\# 3\) Why does this need to exist?

\#\#\# 3.1 Traveler reality (the gap)  
\- Generic travel platforms don’t center LGBTQ+ safety or cultural alignment  
\- Dating apps are risky, often sexualized, and unreliable as “local connection”  
\- Existing “gay experiences” platforms are fragmented, underbuilt, or empty  
\- The best solution today is still: \*\*word of mouth \+ luck\*\*

RTG’s wedge is not “tours.” It’s:  
\> \*\*Trusted LGBTQ+ local connection with standards and structure.\*\*

\#\#\# 3.2 Proof it works (why you)  
You already have:  
\- Real-world demand \+ supply from legacy workflows (HHB learnings)  
\- A clear brand direction (premium, calm, inclusive)  
\- A rebuild moment: move from manual ops to a scalable marketplace

\---

\#\# 4\) Company values (official set)

1\) \*\*Safety First\*\*    
We design and operate for real-world safety: identity verification, clear conduct, fast admin action.

2\) \*\*Radical Respect\*\*    
We protect boundaries. No harassment. No sexual services. Everyone deserves dignity.

3\) \*\*Authentic Connection\*\*    
We optimize for meaningful human connection, not transactional tourism or algorithmic noise.

4\) \*\*Quality Over Quantity\*\*    
Curated cities, vetted guides, and high standards beat bloated directories.

5\) \*\*Accountability & Care\*\*    
We own outcomes: clear policies, responsive support, transparent decisions, continuous improvement.

\---

\#\# 5\) Guide eligibility policy (LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+-friendly)

RTG welcomes \*\*both\*\*:  
\- \*\*LGBTQ+ guides\*\*, and  
\- \*\*LGBTQ+-friendly guides\*\* who demonstrate strong alignment

\*\*Minimum standard (non-negotiable):\*\*  
\- Verified identity (via verification workflow)  
\- Signed agreement to community guidelines \+ boundaries  
\- Profile review \+ manual approval before listing

\*\*Acceptance criteria for “LGBTQ+-friendly” (stricter vetting):\*\*  
\- Clear, explicit inclusive statement in onboarding (“why I enjoy guiding LGBTQ+ travelers”)  
\- No history of discriminatory content (basic review)  
\- Must pass a short “safety & respect” checklist during approval  
\- Zero tolerance for boundary violations → immediate removal

This gives you more supply without diluting trust — while keeping the bar high.

\---

\#\# 6\) Pricing positioning (premium, transparent ranges)

RTG is \*\*premium\*\*. We publish \*\*typical price ranges per city\*\* to set expectations and qualify leads.

\*\*Why publish ranges:\*\*  
\- Pre-qualifies budget and avoids time-wasting  
\- Reinforces “premium \+ vetted \+ private” positioning  
\- Helps guides anchor pricing confidently

\*\*How we present it:\*\*  
\- City page: “Typical private guide sessions in \[City\] range from €X–€Y”  
\- Guide profile: specific rates for \*\*4h / 6h / 8h\*\*  
\- Checkout: clear itemization (session price \+ traveler fee \+ tax note)

(Exact ranges can be tuned per city as you learn conversion.)

\---

\#\# 7\) Safety exclusions policy (recommendation)

You asked: public list vs policy-only.

\*\*Recommendation (best balance):\*\*  
\- \*\*Public-facing:\*\* publish \*\*principles \+ enforcement\*\* (what we do / don’t support) without maintaining a volatile, political “master blacklist.”  
\- \*\*In-product:\*\* if a location is not supported, show “Not available right now” with a short reason category (e.g., “Safety & legal risk”).  
\- \*\*Internal ops annex:\*\* maintain a living \*\*risk register\*\* (countries/regions) with sources, notes, and decision dates.

\*\*Why:\*\* a public blacklist becomes a maintenance burden and a PR lightning rod, and it will go stale. Principles \+ enforcement stays true and easier to keep correct.

\---

\#\# 8\) How do we make money? (3 pillars)

\#\#\# Pillar 1 — Marketplace revenue (v2 core)  
\- Guide commission (target range): \~18–22%  
\- Traveler service fee (target range): \~8–12%

This is the scalable engine: repeatable transactions \+ measurable unit economics.

\#\#\# Pillar 2 — Concierge layer (v2+ but marketed at launch)  
Concierge is part of the story from day one, with a dedicated page:  
\- Pre-trip consult calls  
\- Done-for-you planning  
\- Safety-first recommendations & bookings

\*\*v2 stance:\*\* launch a \*\*/concierge page\*\* with positioning \+ waitlist/lead capture, even if operations run manually first.

\#\#\# Pillar 3 — Ancillary revenue (later expansion)  
\- Upsells (extra hours, add-ons)  
\- Affiliates (hotels, insurance, events, experiences)  
\- Sponsored placements (carefully curated; never undermines trust)

\---

\#\# 9\) What does success look like?

\#\#\# 9.1 v2 launch success (definition of “shipped”)  
A traveler can:  
\- Browse a city → open a guide → request booking → get accepted → pay → message → complete → review

A guide can:  
\- Onboard \+ submit verification → get approved → appear in listings → receive requests → accept/decline → message → complete

Admin can:  
\- Approve/reject guides  
\- View/manage bookings  
\- Handle disputes/refunds (manual actions supported)

\#\#\# 9.2 90-day success (signal of product-market pull)  
\- Clear evidence of demand: city searches, guide profile views, booking requests  
\- First meaningful bookings with strong reviews  
\- Supply playbook working: reliable guide onboarding \+ approvals

\*\*Demand intelligence you should capture from day one\*\*  
\- Top searched cities (visitor \+ traveler)  
\- Searches with no results (supply gap)  
\- Conversion by city page → guide profile → booking request

\#\#\# 9.3 12–24 month success (scale trajectory)  
\- Dozens of high-quality cities with consistent supply  
\- Concierge driving high-margin revenue  
\- RTG recognized as \*the trusted LGBTQ+ private guide brand\*

\---

\#\# 10\) Strategic guardrails (how we avoid chaos)  
\- \*\*Quality \> breadth:\*\* curated cities and invite-only / vetted guides early  
\- \*\*Safety-first enforcement:\*\* clear boundaries, fast bans, admin visibility  
\- \*\*No escort / sexual services:\*\* explicit policy, enforced in reviews \+ reports  
\- \*\*Ship vertically:\*\* complete flows end-to-end before adding new surface area  
\- \*\*Keep the stack simple:\*\* Next.js \+ Supabase \+ Stripe, minimal moving parts

\---

\#\# 11\) v2 scope recap (the real product)  
\*\*Core surfaces\*\*  
\- Public: Landing, Cities, City detail, Guide profile (teaser for visitors), Blog, Legal/Safety, Concierge page  
\- App: Traveler dashboard, Guide dashboard, Booking flow, Messaging  
\- Admin: Approvals, bookings, reviews moderation, content controls

\*\*Core objects\*\*  
\- Profiles (roles), Guides, Cities, Countries  
\- Bookings (status-driven), Messages, Reviews  
\- Verification status \+ approval workflow

\---

\#\# 12\) Open items (v0.2)  
\- Confirm exact fee percentages for launch (initial defaults are fine)  
\- Define the cancellation/refund ladder precisely in legal pages  
\- Confirm which currencies/locales are supported at v2 launch (can start small)  
\- Decide if traveler public profiles ship in v2 or v2.1 (nice-to-have, not core)
