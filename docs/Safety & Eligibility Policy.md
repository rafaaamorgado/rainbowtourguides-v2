\#\# Part A — Public Policy (User-facing)

\#\# 1\) Our promise (and what it is not)

Rainbow Tour Guides exists to help LGBTQ+ travelers feel safer and more comfortable exploring the world through trusted local connection.

We are:  
\- A platform for private guiding and cultural experiences  
\- Built around respect, boundaries, and professional conduct

We are not:  
\- A hookup product  
\- A sex-work marketplace  
\- A place for harassment, coercion, or discriminatory behavior

\---

\#\# 2\) Who can be a guide on RTG

We accept:  
\- \*\*LGBTQ+ guides\*\*, and  
\- \*\*LGBTQ+-friendly / queer-affirming guides\*\* who meet our standards

Minimum requirements:  
\- Agree to our Code of Conduct and non-discrimination rules  
\- Complete identity verification steps required by the platform  
\- Pass a manual review before being publicly listed

\---

\#\# 3\) Code of Conduct (applies to everyone)

\#\#\# Respect & boundaries  
\- No sexual services, requests, or insinuations  
\- No harassment, intimidation, coercion, or “pressure”  
\- No hate speech, discriminatory language, or targeted hostility

\#\#\# Safety and legality  
\- Follow local laws and common-sense safety practices  
\- Do not propose illegal activities or unsafe meeting arrangements  
\- Do not share someone else’s private info outside the platform

\#\#\# Professional expectations  
\- Be punctual and communicative  
\- Keep plans and pricing transparent  
\- Use the platform’s booking and payment flows (no off-platform payment requests)

\---

\#\# 4\) Reporting & support

If something feels unsafe or inappropriate:  
\- Use \*\*Report\*\* inside messages/booking  
\- Contact support via the Help/Support link

We investigate reports and may:  
\- Issue warnings  
\- Suspend accounts  
\- Remove guides from listings  
\- Cancel bookings when needed

\---

\#\# 5\) Where we operate

We only list destinations where:

\- We have vetted, approved supply

You’ll always see our currently supported cities and countries on the site.

\#\# Part B — Internal Ops Annex (Not public)

\#\# 6\) Guide eligibility checklist (manual review)

\#\#\# Identity verification (required)  
\- Government-issued ID uploaded successfully  
\- ID image is readable and matches guide’s profile identity cues (name / photo resemblance where possible)  
\- Any mismatch or unclear document → request resubmission

\#\#\# Platform fit  
\- Bio and tone are professional and aligned (no sexualized positioning)  
\- Claims are plausible and consistent (city, languages, availability)  
\- Experience aligns with “private guide / cultural host” positioning

\#\#\# LGBTQ+-friendly validation (for allies)  
We do not demand proof of identity or “queerness.” We validate \*\*behavioral standards\*\*:  
\- Explicit agreement to queer-affirming conduct \+ non-discrimination  
\- No red-flag language or dog whistles  
\- Communication style: respectful, non-flirty, non-sleazy  
\- If uncertain: follow-up questions \+ probation period (see below)

\#\#\# Decision outcomes  
\- \*\*Approve\*\*: guide becomes visible in city listings  
\- \*\*Reject\*\*: guide cannot list; provide reason codes  
\- \*\*Request changes\*\*: guide edits profile \+ re-submits  
\- \*\*Probation\*\* (optional): approved but monitored (first 1–3 bookings)

\*\*Reason codes (suggested)\*\*  
\- ID unreadable / mismatch  
\- Profile sexualized / escort-like positioning  
\- Discriminatory language or hostile tone  
\- Inconsistent identity/location claims  
\- Refusal to comply with policies

\---

\*\*Actions\*\*

\- Legal risk / enforcement reality

\- Presence of vetted supply (quality-first curation)

\*\*Expansion gate outcomes\*\*
