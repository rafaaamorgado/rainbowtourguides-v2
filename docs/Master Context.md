\*\*Doc ID:\*\* DOC-MASTER-CONTEXT    
\*\*Last updated:\*\* 2026-01-15    
\*\*Scope:\*\* v2 launch and the principles that govern v2.x expansion

\#\# 1\) Vision & Strategy

\#\#\# 1.1 Vision Statement

\*\*One-liner\*\*    
Rainbow Tour Guides is the premium platform for trusted LGBTQ+ local connection — starting with private tours, expanding into curated experiences, concierge planning, and queer-friendly partners.

\*\*What we are (v2)\*\*    
A bookable marketplace where LGBTQ+ travelers can find and book vetted local guides for safe, private, authentic experiences — with clear standards, structured bookings, and integrated payments.

\*\*What we become (v2.x+)\*\*    
A full LGBTQ+ travel ecosystem:  
\- Curated marketplace (guides \+ experiences \+ services)  
\- Concierge layer (done-for-you trip planning \+ safety guidance)  
\- Community layer (events, meetups, partner venues)

\---

\#\#\# 1.2 Company Values (Official)

1\) \*\*Safety without paranoia\*\*    
We reduce risk through vetting, clear standards, and calm guidance — not fear marketing.

2\) \*\*Respect & boundaries\*\*    
We protect travelers and guides with firm expectations: no harassment, no coercion, no sexual services.

3\) \*\*Warm professionalism\*\*    
We feel human and reassuring, while staying premium, concise, and mature.

4\) \*\*Authenticity over tourist traps\*\*    
We optimize for meaningful local connection and real context, not generic “top 10” checklists.

5\) \*\*Quality-first curation\*\*    
We’d rather launch small and exceptional than large and mediocre. Fewer cities/guides done well.

\---

\#\#\# 1.3 Founder Clarity Brief (Operating Summary)

\*\*Why RTG exists\*\*  
\- LGBTQ+ travelers want safety \+ ease \+ real connection; generic platforms don’t serve this well.  
\- “Gay travel” options are often fragmented, overly sexualized, or empty.  
\- Proven manual workflows don’t scale; v2 is the scalable infrastructure.

\*\*Business model (3 pillars)\*\*  
1\) \*\*Marketplace revenue (v2 core engine)\*\*  
   \- Platform commission on guide earnings (target: \~18–22%)  
   \- Traveler service fee (target: \~8–12%)  
2\) \*\*Concierge / Agency revenue (marketed at v2 launch; manual fulfillment initially)\*\*  
   \- Pre-trip consults, itinerary planning, safety guidance  
3\) \*\*Ancillary revenue (later)\*\*  
   \- Upsells, affiliates, partnerships, sponsored placements

\*\*Non-negotiables\*\*  
\- Trust and safety are product features.  
\- We are not a hookup product and not a sex-work marketplace.

\#\# 3\) Market Strategy

\#\#\# 3.1 Positioning  
\*\*Category\*\*: Premium LGBTQ+ travel marketplace for private, vetted local guides \+ concierge planning.    
\*\*Differentiators\*\*: vetting \+ manual approval, calm premium brand (not sexualized), structured booking/payment flows, curated inventory.

\#\#\# 3.2 SEO wedge (Primary)  
Target phrase pattern: \*\*“LGBTQ+ private guide in \[City\]”\*\*    
Primary entry points:  
\- City pages: \`/cities/\[slug\]\`  
\- Guide profiles: \`/guides/\[slug\]\`  
\- Blog mapped to city intent (safety, neighborhoods, culture)

\#\#\# 3.3 Concierge (Public at v2 launch)  
\- Canonical URL: \*\*\`/concierge\`\*\*  
\- Purpose: explain service, collect leads, route users to either booking or planning request  
\- Fulfillment: manual in v2 (ops-run), systematized later

\#\#\# 3.4 Pricing positioning (Publish ranges per city)  
We publish \*\*typical private tour price ranges per city\*\* to set expectations and reduce friction.  
\- City page shows: “Typical private tour range: €X–€Y” (currency per city)  
\- Derived from active guide pricing; updated as inventory changes  
\- Always include clarity note: “Final price depends on duration, season, and availability.”

\#\#\# 3.5 Safety exclusions posture (Official)  
We do \*\*not\*\* publish a global blacklist.  
\- Public: publish \*\*Safety & Eligibility Policy\*\* \+ show where we operate (whitelist by inventory: cities/countries we list)  
\- Internal: maintain an ops-managed exclusions list and expansion gating criteria

\---

\#\# 4\) Brand tone (Operational guidance)

\*\*Voice\*\*: premium, warm, mature, inclusive. Calm confidence.    
\*\*Never\*\*: clickbait safety language; hypersexualization; campy tone.
